## Headers

### This is an `<h1>` tag

Alternately, add ==== on line below heading

### This is an `<h2>` tag

Alternately, add ---- on line below heading

### This is an `<h6>` tag

### Paragraphs

Use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text

## Line breaks

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
Or use a `<br>`

## Emphasis

_This text will be italic_
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
**This will also be bold**
Asterisks are preferred

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

### Unordered

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (\*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.  
Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
  - You can use dashes instead of stars

### Ordered

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods.  
The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Nested blockquotes

> Upper quote
>
> > Inner quote

## Inline Code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

## Horizontal Line

---
